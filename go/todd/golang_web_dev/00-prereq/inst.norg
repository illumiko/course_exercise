* Hands on
** 1
   -  [x] create a type square
   -  [x] create a type circle
   -  [x] attach a method to each that calculates area and returns it
   -  [x] create a type shape which defines an interface as anything which has the area method
   -  [x] create a func info which takes type shape and then prints the area
   -  [x] create a value of type square
   -  [x] create a value of type circle
   -  [x] use func info to print the area of square
   -  [x] use func info to print the area of circle
** 2
   - [x] create a struct that holds person fields
   - [x] create a struct that holds secret agent fields and embeds person type
   - [x] attach a method to person: pSpeak
   - [x] attach a method to secret agent: saSpeak
   - [x] create a variable of type person
   - [x] create a variable of type secret agent
   - [x] print a field from person
   - [x] run pSpeak attached to the variable of type person
   - [x] print a field from secret agent
   - [x] run saSpeak attached to the variable of type secret agent
   - [x] run pSpeak attached to the variable of type secret agent
** 3
   - [x] create an interface type that both person and secretAgent implement
   - [x] declare a func with a parameter of the interfaceâ€™s type
   - [x] call that func in main and pass in a value of type person
   - [x] call that func in main and pass in a value of type secretAgent
